# Arduino-Uno-PC-Controller
A program that can be used for a few neat features when an arduino is connected to a computer by USB.

#All functions work with windows 10 as of now.

## Connect a photoresistor (or any other analog sensor) to control computer brightness based on room lighting.

## Connect a potentiometer (or any other analog sensor) to control computer sound.

## Connect 5 buttons as macros for any function.
